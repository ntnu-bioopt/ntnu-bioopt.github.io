A majority of research activities within the group currently 
involves the application of hyperspectral imaging to 
a wide range of diagnostic problems. 
Hyperspectral imaging combines high spatial and spectral resolution into one
modality, giving images with full spectral resolution in every pixel.
This makes it a promising tool for tissue spectroscopy and optical 
characterization, where both spectral and spatial information
can contribute to deep, non-invasive knowledge of imaged tissue.
The group has two hyperspectral cameras, <a href="http://www.hyspex.no/products/vnir_1600.php">HySpex VNIR-1600</a> (visible - near infra-red range) and <a href="http://www.hyspex.no/products/disc/swir-320i.php">HySpex SWIR-320i</a> (short-wave infrared range).

Applications include 
characterization of the <a href="{{ site.url}}/publications/#1093707">wound healing process</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}/publications/#1186802">detection
of arthritis</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}/publications/#348705">characterization of bruises</a> (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/publications">list of publications</a> for more).
</p>

<p>Applicability of these techniques in the clinic requires
fast and reliable tools for data processing. One
of the goals is to obtain diagnostic parameters 
instantaneously during a patient scan. Some <a href="{{ site.url }}/software">software implementations</a> are available for <a href="{{ site.url }}/publications/1216144">noise removal</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}/publications/#1136599">estimation of skin properties</a>.

<p>The group is participating in the EU projects 
<a href="http://www.iacobus-fp7.eu/">IACOBUS</a> and <a href="http://www.semeoticons.eu/">SEMEOTICONS</a>.
